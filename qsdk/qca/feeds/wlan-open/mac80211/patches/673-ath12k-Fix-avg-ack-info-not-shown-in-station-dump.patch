Subject: [PATCH] ath12k: Fix avg ack info not shown in station dump

Ack signal station info is filling based on the extended feature
flag NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_ACK_SIGNAL_SUPPORT. It was not enabled
in ath12k. Due to this ack signal info, was skipping to print.

Fix it by enabling this flag in ath12k.

Station 00:03:7f:08:52:07 (on wlan2)
...
last ack signal:-95 dBm
last ack signal:-95 dBm
...
